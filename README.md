# Bamazon node.js and mySQL app


## Overview

This app uses node.js, javascript, and mySQL to create an app that allows users to purchase products from a list, as well as for several management functions that allows for the addition of items to the list of products in the database.




This app is a simple non-ecommerce purchasing solution serving customer, manager, and supervisor roles. Customers can select from among products to purchase and set the quantity they wish to buy. Managers can view products on sale, check for low inventories, add to the inventory, and add new products for sale. Supervisors can check total profits for each department and add new departments.
